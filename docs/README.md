## Quick Reference

### Most Used Commands

```vim
:JStatus    " Open interactive status buffer
:J          " Shorthand for :JStatus (when no args)
:JLog       " Show revision history (basic)
:JDiff      " Show diff (basic)
```

### Status Buffer Keybindings

```
r    - Reload status
cc   - Commit changes
new  - Create new change
dd   - Diff file under cursor
o    - Open file under cursor
q    - Quit status buffer
```

## Philosophy

jj-fugitive follows the same design principles as vim-fugitive:

1. **Minimal keystrokes** - Common operations should be fast
2. **Contextual interface** - Commands work on the item under cursor
3. **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't change your normal Neovim workflow
4. **Extensible** - Built with Lua for easy customization

## Getting Help

- **In Neovim**: Use `:help jj-fugitive` (coming soon)
- **GitHub Issues**: [Report bugs or request features](https://github.com/username/jj-fugitive.nvim/issues)
- **Documentation**: Browse this doc/ folder for detailed guides

## Examples

### Basic Status Workflow

```bash
# In your jj repository
nvim

# In Neovim
:JStatus

# In the status buffer
# - Press 'o' on a file to edit it
# - Press 'dd' on a file to see its diff  
# - Press 'cc' to commit your changes
# - Press 'new' to start a new change
```

### Integration with Splits

```vim
" Open status in vertical split
:vsplit | JStatus

" Open status in horizontal split

```
