INTRODUCTION                                        *jj-fugitive-introduction*

jj-fugitive provides a vim-fugitive-like interface for Jujutsu (jj), the
version control system. It brings familiar vim-fugitive workflows to jj's
revision-centric model.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                *jj-fugitive-commands*

:J                      Show jj status in an interactive buffer. Equivalent
                        to |:J| |status|.

:J {command}            Execute arbitrary jj command. Enhanced commands like
                        |status|, |diff|, and |log| open in interactive
                        buffers, while others execute directly.

:J status               Open interactive status buffer with file staging
                        and diff capabilities.

:J diff [file]          Show diff for current file or specified file in
                        enhanced diff view with native jj colorization.

:J log [options]        Show revision history in interactive log view.
                        Supports jj log options like --limit and -r.

                                                                      *:JHelp*
:JHelp [command]        Show inline help for jj commands and flags,
                        extracted from jj --help output.

                                                                 *:JHelpPopup*
:JHelpPopup             Show help popup for current command line context
                        (useful during :J command input).

==============================================================================
STATUS BUFFER                                          *jj-fugitive-status*

The status buffer (|:J| or |:J| |status|) provides an interactive interface
for managing your working copy changes.

==============================================================================
COMPLETION                                          *jj-fugitive-completion*

jj-fugitive provides intelligent command completion for the |:J| command:

- Command names completion (status, diff, log, etc.)
- Flag completion with descriptions extracted from jj --help
- Context-aware suggestions (bookmarks, files, etc.)
- Inline help display with |:JHelp| and |:JHelpPopup|

Tab completion works in the command line, and help can be displayed
contextually during command input.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                      *jj-fugitive-configuration*

jj-fugitive works out of the box without configuration. The plugin
automatically detects jj repositories and adapts to your workflow.

REQUIREMENTS                                        *jj-fugitive-requirements*

- Neovim with Lua support
- jj CLI tool installed and accessible in PATH
- A jj repository (initialized with `jj init` or `jj git clone`)

==============================================================================
INTEGRATION                                          *jj-fugitive-integration*

VIM-FUGITIVE COMPATIBILITY                         *jj-fugitive-vim-fugitive*

jj-fugitive follows vim-fugitive conventions for familiar workflows:

- Status buffer mappings (R for reload, D for diff, etc.)
- Universal g? help key across all buffers
- File operations using <CR>, o for opening files
- Diff navigation with [c and ]c
- Buffer-local keybindings for context-sensitive operations

REPOSITORY DETECTION                               *jj-fugitive-repository*

jj-fugitive automatically detects jj repositories by walking up the directory
tree from the current buffer's location, looking for .jj directories. Commands
are executed from the repository root for consistency.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLES                                                *jj-fugitive-examples*

TROUBLESHOOTING                                  *jj-fugitive-troubleshooting*

Common Issues:

"Not in a jj repository" error:
    Ensure you're in a directory initialized with `jj init` or cloned with
    `jj git clone`. Check that .jj directory exists in repository root.

Command not found:
    Verify jj is installed and in your PATH: `jj --version`

Keybindings not working:
    Ensure you're in a jj-fugitive buffer. Keybindings are buffer-local.
    Press g? in any jj-fugitive buffer to see available commands.
