# jj-fugitive Documentation

Welcome to the jj-fugitive documentation! This plugin brings vim-fugitive-style version control integration for Jujutsu (jj) to Neovim.

## Quick Start

1. **Installation**: See the main [README](../README.md) for installation instructions
2. **Basic usage**: Open a jj repository and run `:J` to show interactive status
3. **Smart completion**: Type `:J <space>` to see all available jj commands with tab completion
4. **Interactive workflow**: Use keybindings in the status buffer to manage changes

## Philosophy

jj-fugitive follows the same design principles as vim-fugitive but adapted for jj:

1. **Minimal keystrokes** - Common operations should be fast
2. **Contextual interface** - Commands work on the item under cursor
3. **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't change your normal Neovim workflow
4. **jj-native** - Preserves authentic jj output and workflow patterns
5. **Extensible** - Built with Lua for easy customization

## Getting Help

- **In Neovim**: Use `:help jj-fugitive`
- **GitHub Issues**: [Report bugs or request features](https://github.com/martintrojer/jj-fugitive.nvim/issues)
- **Documentation**: Browse this doc/ folder for detailed guides
- **Buffer help**: Press `g?` in any jj-fugitive buffer for context-specific help

## Examples

### Enhanced Completion Workflow

```vim
# Multi-level completion examples
:J <space>                    " See all jj commands
:J git <Tab>                  " Shows: push, fetch, pull, clone, remote, etc.
:J git push <Tab>             " Shows: --bookmark, --branch, --help, etc.
:J bookmark <Tab>             " Shows: list, create, delete, set, move, etc.
:J bookmark create <Tab>      " Shows: --revision, --help, etc.
:J log <Tab>                  " Shows: --limit, --template, -r, --help, etc.

# Common operations with completion
:J status                     " Interactive status buffer
:J commit -m "Fix bug"        " Quick commit
:J new -m "Start feature"     " Create new change
:J log -T compact -r main..@  " Show recent changes
```

### Improved Status Workflow

```bash
# In your jj repository
nvim

# In Neovim
:J

# In the status buffer (NEW BEHAVIOR!)
# - Press Enter on a file to see its diff (vim-fugitive standard)
# - Press 'o' on a file to open it in editor
# - Press 's' to open in horizontal split, 'v' for vertical split
# - Press 'd' for unified diff, 'D' for side-by-side diff
# - Press Tab to toggle between diff views
# - Press 'cc' to commit, 'ca' to amend
# - Press 'r' to restore file, 'a' to absorb changes
```

### Log Navigation Workflow

```vim
:J log                        " Open native jj log view
# In log view:
# - Press Enter on a commit to see details
# - Press 'd' to see commit diff, 'D' for side-by-side
# - Press Tab to toggle between diff and details
# - Press '=' or '+' to expand view (show more commits)
# - Press 'e' to edit at commit, 'n' to create new commit
```

### Diff View Workflow

```vim
:J diff myfile.lua            " View diff for specific file
# In diff view:
# - Press Tab to toggle unified/side-by-side
# - Press 's' for side-by-side, 'u' for unified
# - Press '[c' and ']c' to navigate changes
# - Press 'f' to select different formats
```
