# jj-fugitive Documentation

Welcome to the jj-fugitive documentation! This plugin brings vim-fugitive-style version control integration for Jujutsu (jj) to Neovim.

## Quick Start

1. **Installation**: See the main [README](../README.md) for installation instructions
2. **Basic usage**: Open a jj repository and run `:J` to show interactive status
3. **Smart completion**: Type `:J <space>` to see all available jj commands with tab completion
4. **Interactive workflow**: Use keybindings in the status buffer to manage changes

## Quick Reference

```

### Status Buffer Keybindings

r    - Reload status
cc   - Commit changes with message prompt
new  - Create new change
dd   - Show diff for file under cursor
o    - Open file under cursor
q/gq - Close status buffer

## Philosophy

jj-fugitive follows the same design principles as vim-fugitive:

1. **Minimal keystrokes** - Common operations should be fast
2. **Contextual interface** - Commands work on the item under cursor
3. **Non-intrusive** - Doesn't change your normal Neovim workflow
4. **Extensible** - Built with Lua for easy customization

## Examples

### Smart Completion Workflow

```vim
# Basic usage with completion
:J <space>                    " See all jj commands
:J st<tab>                    " Complete to 'status'
:J commit <space>             " See all commit flags
:J log --template <space>     " See template options

# Common operations
:J status                     " Interactive status buffer
:J commit -m "Fix bug"        " Quick commit
:J new -m "Start feature"     " Create new change
:J log -T compact -r main..@  " Show recent changes
```

### Interactive Status Workflow

```bash
# In your jj repository
nvim

# In Neovim
:J

# In the status buffer
# - Press 'o' on a file to edit it
# - Press 'dd' on a file to see its diff  
# - Press 'cc' to commit your changes
# - Press 'new' to start a new change
# - Press 'r' to reload status
```

### Integration with Splits

```vim
" Open status in vertical split
:vsplit | J

" Open status in horizontal split  
:split | J
```
